I am an experienced Data Scientist with multiple projects under my belt covering industry domains from telecom and banking to public sector administration. 

Additionally, since a primary part of my role has been client-facing, I also have experience dealing with technical and non-technical stakeholders both for suggesting problems to investigate analytically and present insights to large groups. 

My focus areas over the years has been consumer analytics (CVM, personalization, marketing attribution, churn etc) and data-driven application design (end-to-end data flows for analytical software solutions). I have also helped develop multiple in-house analytical tools ranging from python libraries for machine learning and purpose-built web scrapping data stores to standalone analytical dashboards using open-source tools like RShiny, plotly-dash, streamlit.
